# EALTH - SMART HEALTHCARE AND MONITORING SYSTEM

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates a fall detection system using a fine-tuned MoViNet model,Report Generation and Mental Health Analysis. The system includes a web application for live detection and video upload analysis, a demonstration of the model's performance, and the model itself.

## Directory Structure

- `Pages for Web Application/`: Contains the HTML files for the web application.
  - `index.html`: The starting point of the web application.
  - `FallDetection.html`: Page for fall detection information.
  - `live-detection.html`: Page for live fall detection using the user's camera.
  - `upload-video.html`: Page for uploading videos for fall detection analysis.
  - `Login.html`: Login page.
  - `SignUp.html`: Sign-up page.
  - `Mental.html`: Mental health detection page.
  - `ModulesPage.html`: Modules overview page.
  - `Report.html`: Report generation page.
- `Fall Detection Demo/`: Contains demonstration videos and the code used to generate them.
  - `Demo Code.ipynb`: The notebook used to generate demonstration videos.
- `Fine Tuned MoviNet Model For Fall Detection with 95% Accuracy/`: Contains the saved MoViNet model and the notebook used for fine-tuning.
  - `movinet_saved_model/`: The saved MoViNet model.
  - `transfer_learning_with_movinet.ipynb`: The notebook used for fine-tuning the model.

## Web Application

The web application provides two main functionalities:

1. **Live Detection**: Uses the user's camera to detect falls in real-time.
2. **Upload Video**: Allows users to upload pre-recorded videos for fall detection analysis.

### Input Mechanisms

- **Live Detection**: Accesses the user's camera to capture live video.
- **Upload Video**: Users can drag and drop video files or click to browse and select files.

### Output Presentation

- **Live Detection**: Displays real-time detection results on the video feed.
- **Upload Video**: Shows upload progress and displays the detection results after processing.

## Demonstration

The `Fall Detection Demo/` directory contains:

- `Demo Code.ipynb`: The notebook used to generate demonstration videos.
- `Demo Video 1.mp4 and Demo Video 2.mp4`: A video generated by running inference on the trained model.

## Dataset Visualizations

The `Dataset.png` file contains charts and visualizations of the dataset used for training the model. These visualizations were generated using Matplotlib and provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.

## Model

The `Fine Tuned MoviNet Model For Fall Detection with 95% Accuracy/` directory contains:

- `movinet_saved_model/`: The saved MoViNet model.
- `transfer_learning_with_movinet.ipynb`: The notebook used for fine-tuning the model.
